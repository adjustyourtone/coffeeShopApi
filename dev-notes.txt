10/28 - took 3 days to get Angular app working. The project dependencies did not support a running ionic environment. Angular/cli needed to be updated to 7.3 and @angular-devkit/build-angular to 0.13
  - front end is not running....

10/29
- set up Auth0 account and set up Roles/Permissions. 
-Defined get_token_auth_header(``)
-was able to finally log in (.us missing in URL)

Where to start: 
Need to make requests to endpoints with permissions. Set up permissions for Baristas first.
